<Steps>
  <Step title="First Attempt Fails">
    The student will recieve this email with a button asking them to "Pay Now". This button links them to pay via a stripe hosted page where they can pay immeditely. Email opens are tracked.

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Attempt Fails (2 Retries)">
    After 2 more retries (3 total attempts to take the payment) the student will recieve the following SMS. The link to pay via stripe is rebranded to our domain to reduce SMS costs and to make the link seem more familiar and have a high click rate.

  <Step title="Eighth Attempt Fails (7 Retries)">
    One more rebranded "pay now" link is SMS'd to the student. If they choose not to pay with the link, and their final retry fails, their membership is automatically cancelled and stripe won't attempt any futher charges ever.

## How to know if a student has been automatically cancelled

Everytime a students membership is cancelled, stripe sends out an automatic reminder email to us saying the following:

    title="Stripe automatic cancellation email example"
    style={{ display:"block",width:"100%",height:"auto",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

## What to do once a student is automatically cancelled

Option 1: If the student is a good member, it is advisable to call them and see if they are still interested in training

Option 2: Let Jayden know so he can send them a membership cancellation confirmation email and update their airtable profile accordingly
