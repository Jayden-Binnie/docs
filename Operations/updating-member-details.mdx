# Link 1: Stripe Customer Portal

Used for **updating card details** and **Stripe account info**.

Members can also **see their invoices** here.

# Link 2: Airtable Details Update

Used for updating **contact info** (like email or phone number).

Changes are **synced automatically** with our mass email service.

# Where to Find These Links

Both links are sent in the **welcome email** when a new member signs up starting October 10th 2025

# If They Lost Their Links

For Airtable Update: We can **resend their update link** by clicking the **"Send Details Update Request"** button inside our Airtable interface. This sends them an email to update their info again.

For Stripe Customer Portal:

Northern Alliance MMA: https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/4gwbK6c8fc3o4gwaEE

This link can also be found in email reminders when a customer misses a payment

<Tip>
  Sometimes a customer might not see all their memberships in the customer portal. This usually happens if they signed up with more than one email address. It's not a problem - just let **Jayden** know and it will be fixed ASAP.
