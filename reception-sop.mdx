## Daily Tasks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Have I checked Airtable for any new trials that may be coming today?">
    Ideally, you already know all the new trial names and whether or not they’ve completed a waiver.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Have I introduced myself to anyone I don't know and confirmed they are in airtable?">
    If they’re not in Airtable, it means they haven’t completed their sign-up. This could be due to missing payment details or waivers. Ask them to re-do their sign-up on the gym iPad or on their phone, and show you once it’s done.

## What To Do If?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trial is in Airtable - but they no-show their trial">
    Tell Jayden ASAP - He will follow up and retarget
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A member wants to cancel, pause, or make changes to their billing">
    They must send an email.

    <Warning>
      No exceptions.

      \
      Pausing or cancelling a membership without the client emailling us can result in:

      - Setting a precedent that they can ignore instructions they agreed to when signing up
      - Pauses and cancellations being missed or billing incorrectly
      - We don't get to track their churn date
      - We don't get an oppurtunity for an exit survey (very valuable feedback which can often save the membership or provide valuable insights)
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A Teenager Under 18 Wants To Enrol">
    They cannot sign themselves up using someone else’s card — the cardholder must complete the sign-up themselves.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Someone wants to pay casually">
    Absolutely Not.
  </Accordion>
