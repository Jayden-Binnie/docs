# Daily Tasks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Airtable for Any New Trials Today" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h2">
    Before classes start, **look in the Airtable Calendar** for any new trial bookings.

    Before a new student comes in, you should already know:

    - The names of new students (and parents, if listed)
    - Whether they have completed their waiver form

    This helps them feel expected and welcome, and shows we’re organised and professional.

    <Warning>
      If you skip this step and make everyone fill out a walk-in form, a trial student might will get pitched twice - this feels awkward and unprofessional.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm New People Are Enrolled in Airtable" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h2">
    If you see someone you **don’t recognise**, **ask their name immediately**.

    Don’t assume they’re signed up - even if they’ve been training for a few weeks.

    For anyone you’re unsure about, check that they’re in Airtable (specifically in the CRM tab).

    If someone is training but not listed in Airtable, it means they haven’t fully completed their sign-up form.

    This usually means they’re missing payment details or a waiver - both are big issues.

    Ask them to either:

    **1) Complete their sign-up** (they should have received an [email prompting them to finish it](#member-not-in-airtable)), or

    **2) Redo their sign-up** completely on the gym iPad or their phone, and show you once it’s done.

    <Warning>
      Do not allow anyone to train without being properly enrolled in Airtable.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Recently Churned Members" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h2">
    Atleast once a week, look over the “Churned Members” list in Airtable.

    This helps you catch anyone who cancelled but is still showing up to train.

    We’ve seen people cancel and keep training - this stops that from happening.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# What To Do If?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trialist Is in Airtable - But They No-Showed">
    If a student is in Airtable but didn’t show up for their trial:

    **Tell Jayden in Facebook group chat ASAP.**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A Member Wants to Cancel, Pause, or Make Changes to Their Billing">
    They **must send an email** to request this.

    <Warning>
      No exceptions.

      **Do not accept:**

      Text messages

      Instagram or Facebook messages

      Verbal requests in the gym

      Parents asking through their kids

      **Pausing or cancelling without an email can cause serious problems, including:**

      Members thinking they can ignore the sign-up agreement

      Missed or incorrect billing

      Lost churn data (we can’t track cancellations properly)

      Missed exit surveys (we lose valuable feedback)
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A Teenager (Under 18) Wants to Enrol">
    Anyone under 18 cannot sign themselves up.

    Their parent or guardian - the person paying for the membership - must complete the sign-up.

    This rule protects us from issues like:

    - Failed payments or chargebacks
    - Legal complications with underage students signing waivers and agreements
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Someone Wants To Pay Casually">
    **Absolutely not allowed under any circumstance.**

    Ask Jayden for further explanation.
  </Accordion>
  <a id="member-not-in-airtable" />

  <Accordion title="A Member Is Training But Cannot Be Found In Airtable">
    There are only two reasons someone might be training but not found in Airtable:

    3. They started signing up but got distracted before finishing the form.
    2. They are intentionally avoiding signing up (to skip payment or avoid filling in details).

    Anyone who starts our sign-up form and doesn’t finish will automatically get an email from us.\
    This email goes out 15 minutes after they abandon the form and again 2 days later.\
    It asks them to complete their enrolment.

    There’s a small chance that our email could end up in their spam or junk folder - remind them to check.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center",overflowX:"hidden" }}>
    <Frame caption="Form abandonment email example">
      <img
        src="/images/retargetingemail.png"
        alt="Form abandonment email example"
        style={{ display:"block",width:"100%",height:"auto" }}
      />
    </Frame>
    </div>

    With this follow-up system in place, most people who still aren’t in Airtable are probably intentionally avoiding signing up.

    Ask them to do one of the following:

    **1) Complete their sign-up** from the email they received (if they already started the process), or

    **2) Redo their sign-up** completely on the gym iPad or their phone, and show you once it’s done.

    <Warning>
      Do not allow anyone to train until they are fully enrolled in Airtable.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Someone Wants a Discount or Says They Can’t Afford Training">
    Do not negotiate prices.

    You teach your members how to treat you.

    Offering discounts or casual deals sets a precedent that we are:

    - Desperate for business
    - Willing to bend rules
    - Not enforcing our own policies
    - Unprofessional
    - Allowing members to dictate terms

    It is your responsibility to teach members how to treat you.

    We never offer discounts on memberships; except for families signing up three or more children.

    See [**Operations → Updating Member Details**](Operations/updating-member-details) for full instructions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Someone Walks In Without Having Talked To Jayden (They Are Not Booked in Airtable)">
    _(They Are Not Booked in Airtable)_

    Ask them to complete a Walk-In Form before doing anything else.
