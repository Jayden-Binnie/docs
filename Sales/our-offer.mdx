# All Booked Trials & Walk-Ins Receive

Every new trial or walk-in will get:

📱 A text message during their class reminding them to check their email.

📧 A sales email offering them a chance to sign up right away and save the \$49 sign-up fee, and get 1 free week.

<Tip>
  They do not get the free week automatically. They must contact Jayden to have it manually applied to their account. (It says this in the email; see below).\
  \
  Getting people to reply to our email reduces the chance we go to spam in the future.

# How to Actually Sell Someone

Even though every trialing lead is automatically followed up, nothing beats signing them up on the spot.

Don’t feel like it’s pushy to ask them to join after their first class; here’s why:

1. **The sale is already framed.**\
   They know they only get one free class and will be asked to make a decision afterward.
2. **There’s no real commitment (they can pause or cancel anytime).**\
   Our memberships can be paused or cancelled anytime. Most people aren’t afraid of signing up - they’re afraid of being locked in.

## Sales Script

After class, just ask:

“Do you want to jump in again sometime this week?”

This question feels friendly and assumes the close.

### If They Sense A Sales Pitch, Or Get Defensive

They might say things like:

- “I need to talk to my partner.”
- “I need to check my schedule.”
- “I didn’t bring my card.”

Just say:

> “All good! You’ll get an email soon with next steps if you’re keen to keep training.”

That’s it.\
No pressure, no awkward objection overcomes.\
This approach surprises people and leaves a good impression.

### If They Seem Ready to Join

When someone’s clearly interested or excited after class, you can ask:

> "Is there anything you’re still not sure about?"

Dosen't feel salesy - but opens the door for immediate sign-ups.

### If They Say Yes (They Have Concerns)

If they share any concerns, listen fully before replying.\
Most worries come down to commitment or money.\
Both can be easily diffused by reminding them that memberships can be paused or cancelled anytime, and that we have a guarantee - if they ever have a bad experience, we’ll refund their last payment on request.\
This keeps the focus on safety and trust, not selling, and reassures them that there’s no risk.

### If They Say No (They’re Ready)

If they say they’re all good or ready to go, encourage their decision.\
Remind them that they get extra benefits, like no sign-up fee and a free week, if they join right away.\
Offer to complete the sign-up with them on the gym iPad.\
You’re not “asking for the sale”; you’re simply helping them take the next step.

<Warning>
  Make sure you tell Jayden if you offered someone the free week.\
  People who receive the sales email are instructed to email Jayden to have the free week added to their account.\
  Each free week must be added manually - if you don’t tell Jayden, it won’t be applied.
</Warning>

# Handling Walk-Ins

If someone just shows up without booking:

1. Have them fill out the Walk-In Form.
2. The form now asks if they are:
   - Doing their first class ever, or
   - Other (Like a parent using the gym area ect)

Only people doing their first class will get the trial class sales email.

<Warning>
  If you skip checking Airtable and make everyone fill the Walk-In Form, they might:

  - Get duplicate texts from Jayden, and
  - Receive the sales email twice.

  This looks unprofessional, so always check the Airtable calendar first.
</Warning>

# Retargeting

Anyone who starts the sign-up form but doesn’t finish will automatically get reminder emails promopting them to finish their sign up:

15 minutes later, and

2 days later.

The same system runs for form abandonment on our website’s “Book a Call” form.
