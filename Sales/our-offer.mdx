# How To Actually Sell Someone

Ultimately all leads will be followed up weather you talk to them or not but nothing beats getting someone signed up in the gym on the spot.

Do not feel like asking them to sign up after their first class is pushy because:

1) We have already framed the sale, prior to them coming in (they know they only get 1 free class and will be expected to make a decision on signing up after it)

2) We are pause or cancel anytime - most people are afraid of commitment, not signing up. 

Sales Script 

Ask if they want to jump in for another class -\> "when are you in next?"

# Walk Ins

WALK IN FORMS WILL NOW ASK IF THE PERSON IS DOING THEIR FIRST CLASS EVER OR ARE THEY A PARENT USING THE GYM AREA OR OTHER

THEY WILL ONLY GET FOLLOW UP IF THEY ARE DOING THEIR VERY FIRST CLASS

IF YOU DONT CHECK, AND JUST MAKE THEM DO A WALK IN FORM - THEY WILL GET FOLLOW UP TWICE AND IT WILL COME ACROSS AS WEIRD
